  Analysis Steps & Findings

# 1. Sender Address (Spoofing)

* Email from: `noreply@m1crosoft-support.com`
* Issue: Domain uses "m1crosoft" with a number "1" instead of letter "i" → typical spoofing trick.

---

# 2. Header Discrepancies

* Analyzed via Google Admin Toolbox
* SPF and DKIM: Failed
* Return-Path: Points to random domain not related to Microsoft
* IP Location: Traced to non-Microsoft server in Vietnam

---

# 3. Suspicious Link

* Displayed as: `https://account-microsoft-support.com/verify`
* Actual Domain: Fake lookalike site; not a Microsoft-owned domain

---

# 4. Urgent Language

* Phrases like:

  * “Your account will be deactivated”
  * “Failure to confirm will lead to deletion”
* Fear-based pressure tactic

---

# 5. Mismatched URL

* Hover shows fake domain, even though the email text appears official.

---

# 6. Grammar & Content Clues

* Unusual phrases:

  * “To prevent account termination...”
  * No personal name or email used – generic salutation
  * Indicates bulk or automated sending
